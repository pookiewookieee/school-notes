# Muscular System

Hi! I am Muscle Guru, here to answer all of your questions. I am a Physiatrist (Doctor who specializes in muscles). This segment of the magazine is my place to share what I learn on the job. I received questions sent in by viewers of the show. I will answer them today.

The first question I got was from a student asking, "Dear Muscle Expert, I'm confused about the different types of muscles in our body. What's  the difference between cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscles? Where are they found and what do they do?" This question is a very common one I get asked all of the time. Cardiac Muscles are muscles that form the walls of the heart and pump blood throughout the body. The Smooth (visceral) muscles are responsible for controlling the organs. Skeletal Muscles are muscles connected to bones using the tendons, these muscles control the bodies movement.

# Muscular System

Hi! I am Muscle Guru, here to answer all of your questions. I am a Physiatrist (Doctor who specializes in muscles). This segment of the magazine is my place to share what I learn on the job. I received questions sent in by viewers of the show. I will answer them today.

The first question I got was from a student asking, "Dear Muscle Expert, I'm confused about the different types of muscles in our body. What's  the difference between cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscles? Where are they found and what do they do?" This question is a very common one I get asked all of the time. Cardiac Muscles are muscles that form the walls of the heart and pump blood throughout the body. The Smooth (visceral) muscles are responsible for controlling the organs. Skeletal Muscles are muscles connected to bones via the tendons.

The second question I got asked was, "Dear Dr. Flex, what's the difference between voluntary and involuntary muscles? Which types
of muscles are voluntary and which are involuntary? Can you give examples of each?" This question is needed to understand the way muscles move. The Voluntary Muscles are a controlled by the person consciously chooses to move that muscle. While Involuntary Muscles are the muscles for organs and bodily systems, these muscles you cant control your brain just does it.

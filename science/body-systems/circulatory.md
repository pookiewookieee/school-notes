Circulatory System
===

### Sub-systems in circulatory system 
- Pulmonary circulation
    - The Interchange of blood, oxygen, and nutrients between the lungs and heart
    - The lungs are where waste is realeased from the blood such as, carbon dioxide 
- Systemic circulation
    - Spreads blood from heart to the rest of the body
    - Completed via the blood vessels: veins, arteries, and capillaries
    - Large Blood Vessels have names
### Similarites and Differnces

| Similarites | Differences |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Both Spread Blood | Pulimonary system only goes to lungs|
| Get Blood From Heart | The systemic system has much more parts covered|

___
### Valves of The heart
- Controls Flow of blood by opening and closing
- Allows blood to flow in one direction
- Mitral and trispid valve control blood flow
### Arteries vs Veins

| Arteries | Veins |
| -------- | --------|
| Push Blood| Pull Blood |
| Red | Blue |
| carrys Oxygen & nutrients | Carries Carbon and Waste |

### Capillaries
- Tiny Blood Vessels connecting arteries and veins
- O₂ delivered
- CO₂ and waste is picked up
___
### Diseases
- ***Atherosclerosis*** - hardening of arteries due to plaque
- ***Myocardial infarction*** (heart attack) - Blockage of blood flow
- ***Prolapsed valves*** - causes backwards flow of blood
- ***Arrhythmia*** - abnormal heart rate
- ***High Blood Pressure*** - makes the heart work harder
## Parts of Blood 

### Blood Is made up of
- Plasma
- White Blood Cells
- Platets
- Red Blood Cells
### Plasma
Plasma is a yellowish fluid that includes
- nutrients
- hormones
- proteins
- waste products
### Spreading Out
- Arteries
    - Oxygenated Blood and Nutrients
- Veins
    - Deoxygenated Blood and Waste
### Cell Funcitons

| Cell Type | Function | Time Alive | Description | Made By |
| --- |---| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Blood Cells | Transmitting Oxgen throughout the body | 4 months | slightly indented, flattened disks | marrow |
| Hemoglobin | colors blood, helps red blood cells | 4 months | key part of the immune system | marrow |
| White Blood Cells | fight germs, make antibodies | Varies Based on which one| protein that carries oxygen | marrow, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes |
| Platelets | work with proteins to fix broken blood vesels | 9 days | oval shaped ***cells*** also called thrombocytes | Bone Marrow|

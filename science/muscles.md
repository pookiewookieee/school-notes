# Muscular System Notes
___
## What is the Muscular System
The muscular system is a body system made up of **640** Muscules.
## What are the five main functions of the muscular sytem
The Muscular System's four main functions are
> Allows For Movement in the Body
> Maintaining posture
> Stabilize Joints 
> Generating Heat
## What are the parts of a muscle
Each muscle is made of sketal muscle tissue, blood vesels, tendons, and nerves.
## What are the main properties of muscles
> Excitable or irritable - capable of reciving and responding to stimulation by nerves 
> Contractible - capable of shortening
> Extendible - extendable
> Elasticity - able to return to resting after being contraced or extending 
> Adaptability - can change in response to how it's use, get bigger or smaller
## What are the two types of muscle movement
> **Voluntary** - controlled consiously by a person such as speaking, walking, writing. 
> **Involuntary** - controlled by the unconsious of the brain, such as heartbeat, intestine moving waste, and breathing.
## What are the types of muscles
> Cardiac - form the wall of the heart and controls your heartbeat
> Smooth (visueral) - weakest of all muscle tissues found in organs and preform unique functions like grinding, churning, or moving
> Skeletal - Connect to the skeleton in at least one place to move parts of bones closer to each other
# How do muscles get their names

## Location
Named for the structure near which a muscle is found
Muscle near the Tibia = Tibalis anterior

## Size
Maximus - largest - gluteus maximus
Medius - medium - gluteus medius
Minimus - smallest - glutueus minimus

## Direction 
Rectus - muscle fibers run parrllel to midline
Transverse - muscle fibers urn perpendicular to the midline
Oblique - muscle fibers run diagonal to midline 

## Number of Origin
Numbers of **tendons** of origin. Prefix determines the number
> bi - two 
> tri - three
> quad - four

## Shape
Deltoid - Having a triangular shape
Trapezius - having a trapezoid shap
Rhombodieus - having a diamond shape
Serratus - having a saw toothed shape

## Origin and Insertion
Origin - attached to less or immovable bone
Insertion - attached to the movable bone

## Connective Tissue
Tendons - attach muscles to bone
Fascia - surrounds muscles and connects muscle to muscle

# Muscle Movement
## Other Body Systems working with muscular system
> Nervous system working with the muscular and skeletal system is essential to the voluntary skeletal muscles.
> If Nerves are seved, they will not be able to produce Muscle Movement
## Diseases of the Muscular System
> Muscular Dystorphy - genetic disease that cause damage of muscle fiber causign weakness, immobility, and imbalance
> Cerebral Palsy - congential disorder that affects the posturem, balance, and motor functions.
> ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) - neurodegenerative disease that causes loss of control on voluntary muscles
> Tendonitis - tendons get inflamed or irratated most common in wrists, elbows, shoulder, and heels causing pain pain and swelling
